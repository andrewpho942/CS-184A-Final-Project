# CS-184A-Final-Project
- To run this project, we used **Google Colab** for the dependencies
1. Connect to the runtime using a GPU (i.e. T4)
2. On the left sidebar of Colab, click the **Files** icon (folder symbol).

3. Drag and drop the following folders from the submitted zip into the Colab Files area:
   - The `small_dataset` folder
   - The `training_metrics` folder

  - Alternatively, you can upload the .zip folders to google colab and run the code snippet to unzip the folders

  - If you do **not have** the `small_dataset` folder, then run the small_dataset_generator.ipynb and integrate it into your file structure

  - If you do **not have** the `training_metrics` folder, run the train_model.ipynb and integrate it into the file structure

4. Once the upload is complete, run the cells below.

- src contains the models for the iypnb files that we worked on
